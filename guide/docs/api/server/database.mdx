You can use the `Database` class to manipulate the point values that the server exposes to the clients. Note that while it's called a "database", it's really just
a thread-safe data structure in memory.

:::note
For maximum versatility, the Rust interface does not provide a database implementation. The generic `RequestHandler` trait is used to get the values to return to the client.
However, in most cases, you would just store the values in a `Vec` or `HashMap`.
:::

## Transactions

All modifications to the internal database are done inside a transaction. All the changes are applied atomically at the end of the
transaction. This makes it impossible for clients to read inconsistent state in a single request.

A transaction can be started on a running server with the `update` method. Inside the transaction, any operations can be performed.
They will be executed in sequence.

:::warning
Because the transaction mechanism acquires a lock on a mutex, it is important to keep each transaction as short as possible. Never perform a blocking operation
inside a database transaction.
:::

## Database Initialization

When adding a device to the `DeviceMap`, an initialization transaction must be specified. This is usually used to add the points
to the database so that when the server is actually created, it can immediately report valid values.

## Updating Points

You can update a point value by calling one of the `update_xxx` method on the `Database` object inside a transaction. The returned boolean
indicates if the update was successful (i.e. the point existed).

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Getting Point Values

You may also use the `Database` as a cache of the most recent value if desired. Each type has a getter method to retrieve the most recently assigned value.

:::note
Since the point may not be defined, the getters can fail. If you try to retrieve a point that doesn't exist using Java and C#, an exception will be thrown.
:::

## Removing Points

Most applications don't need to remove points, but the option is there in case you want to remove points from a running server.
There is a type-specific function for removing every point type given its index. The returned boolean indicates if the point
was defined prior to the call to remove it.
