[Modbus Security](https://modbus.org/docs/MB-TCP-Security-v21_2018-07-24.pdf) is a specification that defines how Modbus TCP is wrapped inside TLS to provide authentication and
encryption. In addition to normal TLS functionality, it defines an X.509v3 extension used for role-based access control (RBAC). The IANA reserved port for Modbus Security is 802.

The presented client certificate must include an extension with OID `1.3.6.1.4.1.50316.802.1` containing an `ASN1:UTF8String`. This string represents the
role of the client and is used to authorize operations. For example, a client with the `historian` role might only be allowed to read
a certain range of values, while a client with the `operator` role might be able to also write coils and registers.

The mapping from the role string to permissions is defined by the user.

This library uses [rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls), a modern TLS library written in safe Rust. It does
**not** depend on OpenSSL or other system libraries, but will interoperate seamlessly with other implementations.

Rustls has been [reviewed](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/raw/main/audit/TLS-01-report.pdf) by a third party and is production ready. It
[outperforms](https://jbp.io/2019/07/01/rustls-vs-openssl-performance.html) OpenSSL in almost every aspect and has the backing of the
[ISRG](https://www.abetterinternet.org/post/preparing-rustls-for-wider-adoption/).

## Configuration

TLS configuration is configured using the `TlsClientConfig` or `TlsServerConfig` structures. They are very similar and contain the following fields:

- `name` (client only):
  * The client verifies that the certificate presented by the server is valid for this name. Check out the next section for the gory details on
  name validation.
  * The client will advertise this name through a Server Name Indication (SNI) extension in the `Client Hello`.
- `peer_cert_path`:
  * Path to the unencrypted PEM file containing the trusted root certificate(s) or the peer self-signed certificate.
- `local_cert_path`:
  * Path to the unencrypted PEM file containing the certificate(s) to present to the peer.
- `private_key_path`:
  * Path to the PEM file containing the encrypted or plaintext private key corresponding to the public key in the presented certificate.
- `password`:
  * Password used to decrypt the private key file. This field should be left empty if the file is not encrypted. See the next section for more details.
- `min_tls_version`:
  * Minimum TLS version to support. Setting this to `Tls1_3` will force the usage of TLSv1.3.
- `certificate_mode`:
  * Mode used to verify the peer certificate.

### Name validation

This section describes how name validation is performed when `certificate_mode` is `AuthorityBased`. When the mode
is `SelfSigned`, name validation is performed indirectly since a byte-for-byte comparison occurs of the entire certificate.

The client always validates the server name when `certificate_mode` is `TrustChain`.

A valid name has the same requirements as a DNS name. This is defined in
[RFC 1034 Section 3.5](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034#section-3.5),
updated by [RFC1123 Section 2.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1123#section-2),
with the additional exception that underscores `_` are allowed. A brief (but incomplete)
definition of a valid name includes:

- One or more labels separated by a single period
- Labels are made of alphanumeric characters `[A-Za-z0-9]`, hyphens `-`, and underscores `_`
- A label cannot start or end with an hyphen `-`
- A label cannot be all numeric
- A label cannot be empty
- Maximum of 63 characters per label
- Maximum of 253 characters total

If the SAN extension is present, the name is validated against it. The SAN may contain multiple names and each name can contain a wildcard `*` character.
The comparison is case-insensitive.

If the SAN is absent, then the `Common Name` from the certificate's `Subject` is extracted and compared. The Common Name cannot contain a wildcard character
and the comparison is case-sensitive. It is effectively compared byte-for-byte with the expected name.

:::tip
New certificates should always include the SAN extension. Performing name verification using the `Common Name`
is still secure, but it is deprecated for new use cases.
:::

### Private Key Encryption

Unencrypted private keys may be stored in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 formats:

* `----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`

* `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----`

Encrypted private keys must be stored in PKCS#8v2 format:
*  `-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----`

Keys encrypted in PKCS#1 format are **not** supported.

The following algorithms are supported when keys are encrypted in PKCS#8v2 format:

- Key derivation functions:
  - scrypt (RFC 7914) **recommended**
  - PBKDF2 (RFC 8018) using one of the following HMAC:
    * HMAC-SHA224
    * HMAC-SHA256
    * HMAC-SHA384
    * HMAC-SHA512
- Symmetric encryption:
  - AES-128-CBC
  - AES-192-CBC
  - AES-256-CBC **recommended**

SHA-1 based key derivation and DES/3DES symmetric encryption are **not** supported because they are insecure.

The OpenSSL [pkcs8 command](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/openssl-pkcs8.html) can be used to
encrypt keys or convert private key formats.

:::tip
Encrypting private keys for use with TLS rarely addresses a meaningful threat model. Encrypting a private key and storing the password in a configuration file
is equivalent to locking your doors and leaving the key under the doormat.
:::

### Certificate Mode

The `certificate_mode` parameter determines how the presented peer certificate is validated.

#### Authority-based

The default `AuthorityBased` mode uses the default `rustls` implementation to check the presented chain of certificates
and verify that the root certificate of the chain is one of those provided in the `peer_cert_path` file.
Most, if not all applications, in the power industry, will have a single root certificate.

This mode validates the chain and the end-entity certificate in accordance with [RFC 5280](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-6).

#### Self-Signed

The `SelfSigned` mode validates that:

* Only a single certificate is presented
* It is a byte-for-byte match of the one specified in `peer_cert_path`
* `NotBefore` and `NotAfter` time fields are valid for the current time

:::note
Name validation is performed *indirectly* in self-signed mode, since the byte-for-byte comparison also compares the internal name fields.
:::

### `AuthorizationHandler`

When creating a Modbus Security server, you also need to provide an `AuthorizationHandler`.
It is used to validate that the client has the permissions for the requested operation. There's
a callback for each function code. You are given the unit ID of the endpoint, information about
what points are requested (either as an `AddressRange` or a 16-bit unsigned integer) as well as
the Role ID that was extracted from the presented certificate.

If your handler returns `AuthorizationResult::Authorized`, then the request is passed to
the appropriate handler and the operation is performed. If your handler returns
`AuthorizationResult::NotAuthorized`, then the request is dropped and an `IllegalFunctionCode`
exception is returned to the client.

### Generating certificates

The following OpenSSL commands are provided for testing purposes only. Real systems will use some kind of specialized CA software for certificate procurement.

#### Full CA chain

- Generate the root CA certificate:
```
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout ./ca_key.pem -out ./ca_cert.pem -subj "/C=US/ST=Oregon/L=Bend/O=Test/CN=DO NOT USE" -nodes -days 3650
```
- Generate the client CSR:
```
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout ./client_key.pem -out ./client_csr.pem -subj "/C=US/ST=Oregon/L=Bend/O=Test/CN=DO NOT USE" -addext "1.3.6.1.4.1.50316.802.1=ASN1:UTF8String:operator" -nodes -days 365
```
- Generate the client certificate:
```
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in ./client_csr.pem -extfile <(printf "1.3.6.1.4.1.50316.802.1=ASN1:UTF8String:operator") -CA ./ca_cert.pem -CAkey ./ca_key.pem -set_serial 1 -out ./client_cert.pem -sha256
```
- Generate the server CSR:
```
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout ./server_key.pem -out ./server_csr.pem -subj "/C=US/ST=Oregon/L=Bend/O=Test/CN=DO NOT USE" -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:test.com" -nodes -days 365
```
- Generate the server certificate:
```
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in ./server_csr.pem -extfile <(printf "subjectAltName=DNS:test.com") -CA ./ca_cert.pem -CAkey ./ca_key.pem -set_serial 2 -out ./server_cert.pem -sha256
```

### Self-signed certificate

- Generate the client certificate:
```
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout ./client_key.pem -out ./client_cert.pem -subj "/C=US/ST=Oregon/L=Bend/O=Test/CN=DO NOT USE" -addext "1.3.6.1.4.1.50316.802.1=ASN1:UTF8String:operator" -nodes -days 365
```
- Generate the server certificate:
```
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout ./server_key.pem -out ./server/entity2_cert.pem -subj "/C=US/ST=Oregon/L=Bend/O=Test/CN=DO NOT USE" -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:test.com" -nodes -days 365
```
